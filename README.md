# ML Learning Journay

Welcome to ML Learning Journay, a personal and public repository documenting my exploration of Machine Learning (ML). This space is dedicated to capturing my learnings, experiments and projects as I progress through the fascinating world of ML. Think of it as both a journal and a portfolio; a place where I record what I study, practice with code and share the projects I complete along the way.

## Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to:
- Track my learning journey in ML step by step.
- Share hands-on projects that demonstrate concepts in action.
- Provide a reference point for myself and others who are starting out in ML.
- Encourage collaboration, feedback, and knowledge sharing with the community.

By keeping this repository public, I hope it can serve as a resource for beginners, inspire others to start their own ML journey, and invite constructive input from experienced practitioners.

## What You’ll Find Here
This repository will grow over time as I learn new topics and complete projects. Expect to see:
- Learning Notes: Summaries of concepts, algorithms, and techniques I study.
- Code Experiments: Small scripts and notebooks where I test ideas, datasets, and models.
- Mini Projects: End-to-end implementations of ML workflows, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
- Reflections: Short write-ups on challenges faced, mistakes made, and lessons learned.

Some areas I plan to cover include:
- Basics of supervised and unsupervised learning
- Regression and classification models
- Neural networks and deep learning fundamentals
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision basics
- Model evaluation and optimization techniques
- Real-world datasets and applications

## Audience

This repository is for:
- Beginners in ML who want to see a practical learning path.
- Peers and collaborators who may want to contribute or provide feedback.
- Future me – so I can look back and see how far I’ve come.

## Contributions

While this is primarily a personal learning space, contributions are welcome! If you spot errors, have suggestions, or want to share resources, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Constructive feedback is always appreciated.

## Disclaimer
I am learning ML step by step, so the content here may not always be perfect or optimized. Mistakes are part of the journey, and I’ll document them openly. Please use the code and notes here as references, not production-ready solutions.

## Final Note
Machine Learning is a vast and evolving field. This repository is my way of staying consistent, practicing regularly, and building a portfolio of projects that reflect my growth. If you’re also on an ML journey, I hope this inspires you to document yours too. Let’s learn, build, and share together!
