# ML Learning Journay
--------------------
Welcome to ML Learning Journay, a personal and public repository documenting my exploration of Machine Learning (ML). This space is dedicated to capturing my learnings, experiments and projects as I progress through the fascinating world of ML. Think of it as both a journal and a portfolio; a place where I record what I study, practice with code and share the projects I complete along the way.

## Purpose
----------
The main goal of this repository is to:
- Track my learning journey in ML step by step.
- Share hands-on projects that demonstrate concepts in action.
- Provide a reference point for myself and others who are starting out in ML.
- Encourage collaboration, feedback, and knowledge sharing with the community.

By keeping this repository public, I hope it can serve as a resource for beginners, inspire others to start their own ML journey, and invite constructive input from experienced practitioners.
